Welcome to my Java practice repository! This is where I solve random coding problems generated by AI, challenges from Codeforces, and other platforms I love to explore. The primary goal of this repo is to store all my code—no matter the source—and build a comprehensive collection day by day.
​
My Target: Solve 1,000+ problems within a year and track my progress as I grow as a programmer
